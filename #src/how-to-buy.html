                                                    amount bidded for both vehicles. For example, if a buyer plans to

                                                    $5,000.00 for one vehicle and $6,000.00 for another vehicle, the

                                                    deposit amount required to place the bid would be $1,100.00 ($500.00

                                                    When you are interested in purchasing a vehicle, you will submit a pre-bid. The highest bid for a vehicle in the pre-bidding round will be transferred to the live auction. For example, you can place your maximum bid at $9,000 and if your bid was the highest bid of the pre-bidding round, it will be submitted at the live auction.

                                                    The deposit is required as a good faith gesture to show that the

                                                    amount bidded for both vehicles. For example, if a buyer plans to

                                                    $5,000.00 for one vehicle and $6,000.00 for another vehicle, the

                                                    amount allows the buyer to place a bid of up to $4,000.00 for each
                                                    vehicle. If the buyer wishes to place a higher bid, the security

                                                    amount bidded for both vehicles. For example, if a buyer plans to

                                                    $5,000.00 for one vehicle and $6,000.00 for another vehicle, the

                                                    deposit amount required to place the bid would be $1,100.00 ($500.00

                                                    <strong>Example:</strong> If you want to place a bid on two separate
                                                    vehicles at once, your security deposit must be at least $800.00.
                                                    This
                                                    amount allows the buyer to place a bid of up to $4,000.00 for each
                                                    vehicle. If the buyer wishes to place a higher bid, the security
                                                    deposit
                                                    must be increased so that it contains a minimum of 10% of the total
                                                    amount bidded for both vehicles. For example, if a buyer plans to
                                                    bid
                                                    $5,000.00 for one vehicle and $6,000.00 for another vehicle, the
                                                    total
                                                    deposit amount required to place the bid would be $1,100.00 ($500.00
                                                    for
                                                    the first vehicle and $600.00 for the second). The deposit

                                                    applies to all transactions regardless of how many vehicles are

                                                    bidded on.
